# Description :

In  this  we  will going  to make  a  web  based  medical  website  for  management  purpose  and  helping peoples. Over  time,  problems  meant  to  be  solved  by  software  engineering  have  grown  more  and  more complex.  Today,  development  model  where  designer,  implementer  and  maintainer  of  enterprise  class software is one and the same person throughout application's life cycleis mostly unthinkable.Designing Web-applications   is   considerably   different   for   mobile   computers   (handhelds,   Personal   Digital Assistants) than for desktop computers. The screen size and system resources are more limited and end-users  interact  differently.Consequently,  detecting  handheld-browsers  on  the  server  side  and  delivering pages optimized for a small client form factor is inevitable. The authors discuss their experiences during the design and development of an application for medical research, whichwas designed for both mobile and  personal  desktop  computers.  The  investigations  presented  in  this  paper  highlight  some  ways  in which Web content can  be adapted to make it more  accessible to mobile  computing users. As a result, the  authors  summarize  their experiences  in  design  guidelines  and  provide  an  overview  of  those  factors which have to be taken into consideration when designing software for mobile computers
